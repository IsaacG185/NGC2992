NOTE: for obB, I had to change powerlaw norm to 1e-2 value (1e-3 in obA). When laor isn't present, bknpower norm value is adjusted to 1e-2 and powerlaw is not adjusted.

without bbody, 301: 573.9562
with bbody, 301: 311.9678
bbody is worth it statistically; serves as a temporary placeholder for a more detailed model.

XMM_A_test_no_laor, without laor, 301: 311.7069
XMM_A_test_laor, with laor, 301: 291.8192
laor is not worth it statistically with the given parameters

XMM_B_test_no_laor, without laor, 201: 359.8986
XMM_B_test_laor, with laor, 201: 330.0492
laor is not worth it statistically with the given parameters


See what laor parameters I can freeze, start with freezing index at 3
If temp of bbody >100 eV, freeze bbody temp (Rayleigh Jeans and Wein).
Then, Test TBpcf.pcf frozen values from .85 to 0 (Try to remove/change TBpcf)


Comparing to XMM_A_test_laor and XMM_B_test_laor:

XMM_A_test_laor, with laor, 301: 291.8192
XMM_B_test_laor, with laor, 201: 330.0492

XMM_A_adj1 (laor(1).Index now frozen to 3): 293.5623
XMM_B_adj1 (laor(1).Index now frozen to 3): 339.3110

Although the difference between the kai squared values of XMM_B_test_laor and XMM_B_adj1 is significant, it is not physically possible for the index to change enough between the two observations (two days between the observations) such that the index changes from a statistically insignificant to statistically significant value. We will freeze it for now and will come back to it should it be deemed necessary.

XMM_A_adj1 (laor(1).Index now frozen to 3): 293.5623
XMM_B_adj1 (laor(1).Index now frozen to 3): 339.3110

Temp is greater than 100 eV, so no need to keep bbody(1).kT open. We will freeze this and test TBpcf(1).pcf values

XMM_A_adj2 (bbody(1).kT now frozen to 1.1): 293.5182
XMM_B_adj2 (bbody(1).kT now frozen to 1.1): 340.7198


XMM_A_adj3: Runs a function that tests XMM_A_adj2 with the pcf frozen at 0.85 and decreasing by 0.5 every time.
XMM_B_adj3: Runs a function that tests XMM_B_adj2 with the pcf frozen at 0.85 and decreasing by 0.5 every time.

XMM_A_adj2 (bbody(1).kT now frozen to 1.1): 293.5182

vFV (EFE) = power=3; avoid use when possible; apply ccd models to RGS data, bin RGS data (uniformily; one min_chan value and rebin_data), as needed; absorption model (zTBabs * powerlaw) should see dips in 0.7 for Fe and 0.9 Ne) in RGS data, won't really appear in CCD (pn data) as it is not as clear.

Abstract Brainstorming:

Black hole, accretion, torus, obscuration between the accretion disk and torus, hot atmosphere within accretion disc, corona closest to black hole and jet coming out corona. Jet generates powerlaw, and that is affected by TBpcf (maybe is there; there is coverage, but the fraction at which the coverage exists is unclear; ~90-80% coverage; there maybe could be something in the lower energy from the coverage in the model). Scattering off torus is pexmon. Powerlaw not characterized precisely, pexmon we're completely sure of. Pexmon * relativity (not sure if its there): cold accretion disc and cold torus. In the hot atmosphere, the oxygen VIII line (for sure is there) and Iron 26 line (maybe there, very difficult to see) originates.

Silicon Ka, don't know if it actually exists (look at RGS data; it exists in the CCD data of probably NuSTAR).

Pexmon is far away from BH center, can't change in time scales of observation,, shouldn't vary as much as the other stuff. Base all analyses on the static qualities of pexmon.
