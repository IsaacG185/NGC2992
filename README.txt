IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO LOOK AT data_Extraction_Calibration_And_Cleaning, LOOKING AT ITS RESPECTIVE README.txt TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROJECT WAS PREPARED IN THE MOST SCIENTIFICALLY 
APPROPRIATE MANNERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO THE FIELD OF HIGH X-RAY ASTRONOMY AND ARE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT A RESEARCH PROJECT LOOKS LIKE.

Hello! This repository includes all of my research work on the NGC 2992 object.
My work is sectioned off into academic terms (i.e. the repositoriess summer_2025, fall_2025, etc.), and is based off the following observations:

NuSTAR ObID 90501623002: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/nustar/data/obs/05/9//90501623002/
NuSTAR ObID 60160371002: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/nustar/data/obs/01/6//60160371002/
XMM-Newton ObID 0840920301: https://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-web/#search (Click on "Filters for Observation, Proposal and Catalogue Searches" drop-down, type in 0840920301 in Observation ID box, and scrhool down to click "Search")

This project is initially focused on "The lively accretion disc in NGC 2992-I. Transient iron K emission lines in the high-flux state", Marinucci et al., 2020, MNRAS 496, 3412-3423, and will be referred to extensively in my analysis 
(link: academic.oup.com/mnras/article/496/3/3412/5857190?searchresult=1). The work in this project based off that paper is described in g_isaac_summer_research_2025.txt.

The methods utilized to obtain the data (essentially a repetition of what is above), extract it using the respective extraction tools, calibrating via the documentation provided for each respective telescope,
and cleaning the data as described by all of these mediums, is located in data_Extraction_Calibration_And_Cleaning.

--FINDINGS--

This section details all scientific findings of mine related to NGC 2992. These findings can be replicated utilizing the process detailed in data_Extraction_Calibration_And_Cleaning first, and
then the methods detailed below.
