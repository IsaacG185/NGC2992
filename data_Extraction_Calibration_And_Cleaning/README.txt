This document details how my project was prepared as per scientific guidance by my undergraduate mentor Dr. Michael Nowak (https://sites.wustl.edu/manowak/). Please follow the
following instructions to prepare your system for the project software/tools, methods, and analyses in vertical order, starting with --INSTALLATION PROCESS-- first and going downward.

--INSTALLATION PROCESS--

The following must be installed on your system. Instructions are detailed below, with descriptions of each software/package that is being installed:

    - SAOImageDS9: https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9
	- Interactive Spectral Interpretation System (ISIS): https://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/install.html
	- HEASOFT: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/index.html
	- Isisscripts: http://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/isis/ (a copy is provided in the "Scripts" subdirectory)
	- XMSAS: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/download-and-install-sas

    --INSTALLING SAOImageDS9--
        - Input the following link into your system's browser: https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9
        - From there, click the big blue "DOWNLOAD" button on your screen. Pick the most recent "Release Version" (it should be the one you first see),
        then click on the icon associated with your operating system. Pick the version that is most relevant to you, following any instructions in the dropdown
        if such appear.
    
    --INSTALLING HEASOFT--


    --INSTALLING Interactive Spectral Interpretation System (ISIS)--
        - Input the following link into your system's browser: https://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/install.html.
        - Follow the instructions under the II. Manual Installation section. This section is preferred to the I. Scripted Installation as it shows you exactly what is being installed and what
        it is being used for. If you are familiar with ISIS, feel free to follow the I. Scripted Installation, although I have not used that method before and thus am not entirely certain 
        on its functionality.
        - IMPORTANT: Note that some of the ISIS process detailed requires the installation of other tools, such as XSpec. These parts, if you are following these instructions in vertical order, should
        be ready to go and do not require another installation as detailed in the ISIS webpage above.

--TESTING--
The following details methods to test all that you have done so far and ensure that it all functions properly.

Now that all the testing is complete. You may proceed to data extraction.
