We investigated the X-ray emission characteristics of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2992, focusing on emission lines, variability, and obscuration. 
Four datasets—two each from the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton space telescopes—were utilized. Analysis of XMM-Newton RGS1 data in the 0.5–0.7 keV range revealed a soft X-ray excess. 
NuSTAR color-to-color diagrams in the 3–79 keV range allowed characterization of temporal variability, particularly of the Fe Ka emission line, providing insight into its 
location and strength relative to the black hole.

We confirmed the presence of the Fe Ka line at ~6.4 keV, likely originating from the torus, but were unable to validate three distinct iron emission lines reported by 
Marinucci et al. (The lively accretion disc in NGC 2992 – I. Transient iron K emission lines in the high-flux state) without introducing statistical bias. 
An O VIII emission at ~0.65 keV was observed, potentially tracing hotter AGN structures relative to the torus, such as the corona or outflows. Partial obscuration by 
surrounding gas was modeled, showing significant improvements in fit statistics. Data suggest a possible Fe XXVI emission at ~6.97 keV, warranting further investigation.

These findings support a model of NGC 2992 as a supermassive black hole with a jet along its rotational axis, a partially obscured accretion disk, and a distant torus. 
Future work includes refining the soft X-ray excess characterization, constraining obscuration fractions, and exploring relativistic effects in iron emission lines, 
contributing to a deeper understanding of AGN structure and the Seyfert unification model.
